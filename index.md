### Projects

- [Flash Game Project (2021)](https://editor.p5js.org/nolangibson22/full/-BWtpz0zp)
 <p>A short flash game I created using p5.js. The user has to look around the screen until they find something that lights up to progress.</p>
- [Space Animation Project (2022)](https://editor.p5js.org/nolangibson22/full/Mc7eZtqz1)
 <p>An art project I created through p5.js. It shows a planet in space with shooting stars revolving around it.</p>
- [User Interaction Project (2022)](https://editor.p5js.org/nolangibson22/full/6JGrFneIc)
 <p>An art project that involves user interaction. Depending on where the user moves their mouse, the character's eyes will follow that direction. The project was created on p5.js.</p>
- [EasyGo (2022)](https://www.figma.com/file/0g2gP0Is1R9R8JM3FxtY4C/EasyGo-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1&t=iJuHpkC1YvLLnDf4-1)
  <p>A campaign project that was made to raise awareness about the lack of recycling bins in Midtown Manhattan. I created the wireframe and mockups on Figma.</p>
